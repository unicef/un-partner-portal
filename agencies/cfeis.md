# CFEIs

Calls for Expression of Interests are live at the heart of UNPPâ€™s Agency and Partner Relationships. This tool is key in communicating the needs for a project and the ability for UN Agency parties to identify and select the appropriate Partners for a particular Project.

## Sections

There are three main tabs that live within this section:

1. Calls for Expression of Interests
   1. A dedicated table that is filterable, displaying all current CFEIs in the System.
2. Direct Selections
   1. Similar to the previous section \(tab\) however instead of the competitive process, the Direct Selection bypasses the open selection process and allows Agency Users to reach out directly to their partners of choice.
3. Unsolicited Concept Notes

   a.     Unsolicited Concept Notes or \(UCNs\) are created and submitted by partners and are reviewed before making a partner selection for rewarding a partner the project.
