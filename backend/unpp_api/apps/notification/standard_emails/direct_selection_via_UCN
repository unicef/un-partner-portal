Dear prospective partner,

The UN has identified your organization for a partnership opportunity via direct selection on the basis of an unsolicited concept note entitled {{ eoi_title }}

Please access the UN Partner Portal to indicate whether you would like to accept or decline the partnership opportunity. Should you accept, the next step in the process will be for the UN and your organization to collaborate to develop the unsolicited concept note into a detailed partnership agreement.

Thank you.
