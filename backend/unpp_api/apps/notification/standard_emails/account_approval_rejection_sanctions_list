Dear prospective partner,

Thank you for your interest in the UN Partner Portal.

The UN Partner Portal is only open to those partners who share the UN’s core values and agree to the Partner Declaration.

The UN Partner Portal identified that the information entered by your organization at the account registration stage resulted in a match with an entry on the UN Security Council’s Consolidated Sanctions List.

Your organization’s account registration request will be reviewed by the UN Partner Portal administrator and your organization may be requested to provide additional information to validate or invalidate the Sanctions List match.

Thank you.
