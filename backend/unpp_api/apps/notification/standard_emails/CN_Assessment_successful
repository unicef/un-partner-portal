Dear prospective partner,

The UN recently posted a call for expressions of interest on the UN Partner Portal to which your organization responded by submitting an application.

The review of applications has now concluded. Your organizationâ€™s application was selected! Please access the UN Partner Portal to indicate whether you would like to accept or decline the partnership opportunity. Should you accept, the next step in the process will be for the UN and your organization to collaborate to further develop the concept note into a detailed partnership agreement.

Thank you.
