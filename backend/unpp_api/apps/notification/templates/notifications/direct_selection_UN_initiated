Dear prospective partner,

The UN has identified your organization for a partnership opportunity via direct selection.

Please access the UN Partner Portal to indicate whether you would like to accept or decline the partnership opportunity. Should you accept, the next step in the process will be for the UN and your organization to collaborate to develop a detailed partnership agreement.

Thank you.
