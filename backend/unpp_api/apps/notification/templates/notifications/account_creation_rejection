Dear prospective partner,

Thank you for your interest in the UN Partner Portal. 

The UN Partner Portal is only open to those partners who share the UN’s core values and agree to the Partner Declaration. 

Your organization did not agree to the Partner Declaration in full. As a result, your organization’s account registration request has not been approved. 

If you have any further questions about your eligibility to register an account on UN Partner Portal, please contact the administrator.

Thank you.
