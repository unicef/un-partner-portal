Dear prospective partner,

The UN recently posted a call for expressions of interest on the UN Partner Portal to which your organization responded by submitting an application.

Unfortunately, due to a change in the programming context, the UN has had to cancel this call for expressions of interest. The application that your organization submitted will not be considered at this time.

Please continue to visit the UN Partner Portal for other partnership opportunities.

Thank you.
