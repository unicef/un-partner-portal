## Registered Users

### Overview

After completing the registration process, the user will be limited to a number of actions due to their profile not being complete. 

UNPP requires users to have completed their account profiles before moving further within the application.

A profile is comprised of the following seven tabs:

* Identification
* Contact Information
* Mandate & Mission
* Funding
* Collaboration
* Project Implementation
* Other Information

In this section, we will review all seven tabs in detail, and provide details to what information a user must provide in order to successfully complete their profile.

However, it is important that the user include the following information to complete this section of their profile:

* Legal Status
  * Year of establishment in country
  * Include Governing Document if available.
  * Organization's registration to operate.
