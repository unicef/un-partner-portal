# About

## Purpose

The UN Partner Portal \(UNPP\) is an open source platform designed to support the harmonization and simplification of business processes associated with working with Civil Society Organizations \(CSOs\). 

A collaboration between UNHCR, UNICEF, and WFP, the UNPP will serve as a central database for the registration of CSOs, as well as a platform for due diligence screening and management of calls for expression of interest \(i.e. submission, review, and selection of concept notes.\).

## Design Philosophy

A major goal was to stay consistent with design across all UNICEF projects.

The layout was divided into three parts:

* Top Bar
* Navigation Drawer \(left\)
* Static Notification & User Settings Icons

To accomplish this goal, the application was greatly made possible with the help of three resources. 

* **Material Design**
  * Material Design elements, commonly used in many apps across the web, create clean layouts that are responsive and easy to understand by users \(especially if they are familiar with other unicef platforms\).
* **InVision**
  * InVision is a prototyping, collaboration and workflow tool. InVision gives you clarity, collaboration, and control of everything you need to power your design process. It allows you to efficiently and simply create interactive mockups for your wireframes and designs.
* **Sketch**
  * Sketch is a prototyping, design toolkit built to help you create from your earliest ideas, through to final artwork.
