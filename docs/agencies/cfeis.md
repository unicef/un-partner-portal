# CFEIs

Calls for Expression of Interests are live at the heart of UNPPâ€™s Agency and Partner Relationships. This tool is key in communicating the needs for a project and the ability for UN Agency parties to identify and select the appropriate Partners for a particular Project.

## Sections

There are three main tabs that live within this section:

1. Calls for Expression of Interests
   1. A dedicated table that is filterable, displaying all current CFEIs in the System.
2. Direct Selections
   1. Similar to the previous section \(tab\) however instead of the competitive process, the Direct Selection bypasses the open selection process and allows Agency Users to reach out directly to their partners of choice.
3. Unsolicited Concept Notes

   a.     Unsolicited Concept Notes or \(UCNs\) are created and submitted by partners and are reviewed before making a partner selection for rewarding a partner the project.

### CFEI Details

Once selecting an individual CFEI from the available lists, the user will be able to dive deeper into the informations for this particular project.

On the top section of the screen, the user will be presented with a few features to help them quickly identify the category, and status of the CFEI.

A label is present just above the CFEI's **Title** to indicate if the CFEI is categorized as an "Open Selection" or not. 

Just below the **Title **sits the following list of tabs:

* Overview
* Applications
* Preselected List

#### CFEI: Finalization

Once the process of creating an Call for Expression of Interest is made, a partner is reviewed and a selection is made, the last step is for the Agency User to Finalize the CFEI.

On the top hand corner, a button for Finalizing is available. Once clicked, a modal will appear with the following options:

* Confirm the desire to finalize the CFEI
  * Choose reason for completing CFEI

### Unsolicited Concept Notes

When a CFEI has been created and either made public or sent directly to a specific partner\(s\) the Partner in return provides a documentation called a Concept Note back to the Agency in order to be selected for a project. 

When viewing a list of CFEIs, the user can access a list of Unsolicited Concept Notes \(UCNs\) which display the following:

* Project Details
  * Organization's Legal Name
  * Type of Organization
  * Project Title
  * Sector and area of Specialization
* Concept Note
  * Ability to download the Concept Note the Partner has Attached.

Furthermore, the Agency User has the ability to view the partner's profile or Convert the UCN to a Direct Selection.

* Other Information \(optional\)
