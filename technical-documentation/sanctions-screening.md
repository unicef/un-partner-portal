# Sanctions Screening

## Overview

Once a partner completes their account registration their account is then screened against the UN Sanctions list before finally being approved to proceed.   
  
An automated process of checking against  the UN sanctions list \( [https://scsanctions.un.org/resources/xml/en/consolidated.xml](https://scsanctions.un.org/resources/xml/en/consolidated.xml) \) is done within the system and confirmed notifying the user they can proceed. 

This automated check of the Sanctions list is run on a regular basis and checks multiple Parter criteria for validation. 

If a screen fails for whatever reason, the partner will will receive a flag for review and final verification.
